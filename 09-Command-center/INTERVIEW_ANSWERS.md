#  9 – Interview Answers

1. **Single pane content:** Highlight golden signals, alert status, incident timelines, and key dependencies while keeping layouts simple; rotate less-critical panels off the page to avoid clutter.
2. **Measuring dashboard value:** Track MTTR trends, survey responders, and review incident timelines to see whether the command center reduced tool-switching or sped up decision making.
3. **Cross-team sharing:** Establish style guides, reusable panel templates, and review processes so dashboards remain consistent even when multiple teams contribute.
4. **Synthetic monitoring on wallboards:** Adds the outside-in perspective that internal metrics might miss, making it easier to catch DNS/CDN issues that don’t register inside the data center.
5. **Handling secrets:** Use read-only service accounts, store credentials in secure config (vault/SSM), and avoid embedding tokens or sensitive data in shared dashboards or kiosk URLs.
